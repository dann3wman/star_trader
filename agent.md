# Development Guidelines

Please keep all Python code formatted using the [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) code style. Run `black` on any modified `*.py` files before committing changes to maintain a consistent style across the project.

When you complete an item from `REFACTORING.md`, cross it off using Markdown strikethrough and append at least one new refactoring opportunity to the end of the list. This keeps the document current and encourages continued improvements.
